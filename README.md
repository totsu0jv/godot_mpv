## Usage

```gdscript
extends Node3D

var mpv_player: MPVPlayer

func _ready():
    mpv_player = MPVPlayer.new()
    add_child(mpv_player)
    mpv_player.initialize()

    #Store reference to a MeshInstance3D (plane)
    var mesh_instance = $Screen

    mpv_player.connect("texture_updated", func(texture):
        var material = mesh_instance.get_surface_override_material(0)
        if not material:
            material = StandardMaterial3D.new()
            mesh_instance.set_surface_override_material(0, material)
        material.albedo_texture = texture
        material.shading_mode = StandardMaterial3D.SHADING_MODE_UNSHADED
    )

    mpv_player.load_file("res://path/to/your_video.mp4")
    mpv_player.play()
```

## Installation

Download and extract the GDextension files from the release page into your project ```bin``` directory.

## Build from source


## Linux
<strong>Requirements</strong>
- MPV installed on the system <em> (install step for [mpv-build](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build) listed in the build steps)</em>
- EGL and OpenGL ES2 <em>(usually comes with GPU drivers, if not present install with the command linked bellow this text)</em>
```bash
sudo apt install libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
```
- GLAD (to load OpenGL and use EGL/GLES2 headers, use the generator [here](https://gen.glad.sh/))
> GLAD configuration: 
> EGL 1.5 
> GLES2 3.2
> ✅ Loader
- CMake for project compilation <em>([CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/))</em>

### <em>build steps</em>
Install CMake (link above)


Clone the project
```bash
git clone git@github.com:VersaYT/godot_mpv.git
```
Cd into dependencies folder and clone mpv-build
```bash
cd godot_mpv && cd dependencies
git clone https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build.git
cd mpv-build
```
Fetch mpv packages
```bash
./rebuild -j4
```
The ```-j4``` asks it to use 4 parallel processes.

Install mpv
```bash
sudo ./install
```
cd at the root directory of the project
Configure CMake for the project
```bash
cmake -S . -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B ./build
```
Compile the project (you can of course allow more threads when compiling "-j8")
```bash
cmake --build ./build -j4
```
---
## Windows
<strong>Requirements</strong>
- GCC compiler for windows (can be downloaded [here](https://winlibs.com))
- A compiled version of libmpv <em> (you can find one here [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/))</em>
- ANGLE (for EGL and GLES2 headers) <em>(will be installed in the project when you use ```CMake .``` command)</em>
- vcpkg (to retrieve ANGLE library)
- GLAD (to load OpenGL and use EGL/GLES2 headers, use the generator [here](https://gen.glad.sh/))
> GLAD configuration: 
> EGL 1.5 
> GLES2 3.2
> ✅ Loader
- CMake for project compilation <em>([CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/))</em>

### <em>build steps</em>
GCC compiler setup (if you don't have it)
- Download and extract the archive found in the website linked above (any version > GCC 12)
- Type "Env" in windows search and click on "edit system environment variables"
- Click on "environment variables"
- Look in "system variables" for your "Path" variable
- Add a new line to this variable
- Copy and paste the path to the previously extracted gcc compiler (we want to target the bin/ folder) for example ```C:\mingw64\bin```

Install CMake (link above)

Clone the project
```powershell
git clone git@github.com:VersaYT/godot_mpv.git
```
Pull vcpkg submodule
```powershell
cd godot_mpv
git submodule update --init
```
cd into dependencies folder
```powershell
cd dependencies
```
Download libmpv and GLAD from the links above
- Create an ```mpv-dev``` folder and extract the content of downloaded mpv into it
- Create a ```glad``` folder and extract content of downloaded GLAD into it


From powershell, make sure CMake and GCC are working
```powershell
cmake --version
gcc --version
```
cd at the root directory of the project
Configure CMake for the project
```powershell
cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
Compile the project (you can of course allow more threads when compiling "-j8")
```powershell
mingw32-make -j4
```
